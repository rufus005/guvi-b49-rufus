    <h3>Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2</h3>
    <p>
        
    HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used by the World Wide web to transmit and receive data.
 The HTTP/1.1 protocol has been in use for over two decades but with the advancement  of technology, 
 a new protocol HTTP/2 was introduced in 2005. In this blog, we will discuss main differences HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.
    </p>
    <p>
           1.  Multiplexing. One of the Major differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 is the way they handle multiple requests.
        In HTTP/1.1, each request has to wait for a response before the next request can be sent however in HTTP/2 
        multiple request can be sent sent and receive at the same time without waiting for previous  request to complete. 
         </p>
         <p>
         2.  This features called multiplexing , and it significantly reduced latenly and improve performance.
        Binary protocol; another significant difference is that HTTP/2 is a binary protocol, whereas HTTP/1.1 is a text - based protocol.
        This means that HTTP/2 data is transmitted in binary format, which is more  efficient than the text that HTT/1. data is
        </p>
         3.   Binary data can be processed more quickly by computers, and it reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted,
         which improves performance.
            <p>
          4. Server push.HTTP/2 supports server push, which allows the server to push resources to the client before the client requests them.
        This feature can improve page load times, as the server can push resources that it knows the client will need, such as 
        images or stylesheets, without waiting for the client to request them.
            </p>
           5.  Header compression: In HTTP/1.1, headers are sent with each request and response, which can add significant overhead to the 
        communication. HTTP/2 uses header compression, which reduces the size of headers, resulting in less data being transmitted and 
        improving performance.
        <p>
               
              6.   TLS encryption: While TLS encryption is optional in HTTP/1.1, it is mandatory in HTTP/2. This ensures that all data transmitted 
        between the client and server is encrypted, which improves security.
    </p>

    <h3>Write a blog about objects and its internal 
        Representation in Javascript</h3>

        <p>
           1.  JavaScript is a popular programming language that is used to create interactive and dynamic websites. One of the fundamental concepts
         in JavaScript is the object. In this blog, we will discuss objects and their internal representation in JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
            2. An object in JavaScript is a collection of properties, which are key-value pairs. The keys are always strings, and the values can be 
        any data type, including other objects. Objects can be created using object literals, constructors, or object creation methods such as
        Object.create().
    </p>
        <p>
          3.  Internally, JavaScript objects are represented as a collection of properties, which are stored in a hash table or a dictionary. Each 
        property is stored as a key-value pair, where the key is a string and the value can be any JavaScript data type, including other objects.
    </p>
    <p>
           4.  When an object is created, it is allocated memory on the heap. The properties of the object are stored in the hash table, and each 
        property is assigned a unique integer identifier, called an internal slot. This internal slot is used by the JavaScript engine to 
        access the property values of the object.
    </p>
    <p>
           5.  In addition to properties, JavaScript objects also have an internal prototype property, which is used for inheritance. The prototype 
        property is also an object, and it contains properties that are shared among all instances of a particular object type. When a property 
        is accessed on an object, the JavaScript engine first looks for the property in the object itself. If the property is not found, the 
        engine then looks for the property in the object's prototype chain until it reaches the end of the chain.
    </p>
    <p>
          6.   In JavaScript, objects are mutable, which means that their properties can be changed or added at any time. This is because objects 
        are represented as a collection of properties in a hash table, which can be modified dynamically.
    </p>
    <p>
           7.  In conclusion, objects are a fundamental concept in JavaScript, and they are represented internally as a collection of properties 
        stored in a hash table. Objects can be created using object literals, constructors, or object creation methods, and they have an internal 
        prototype property that is used for inheritance. Understanding how objects are represented internally in JavaScript is essential for 
        creating efficient and effective code in the language.
